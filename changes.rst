.. _v2.5.3:

`Version 2.5.3 <https://github.com/MiniZinc/MiniZincIDE/releases/tag/2.5.3>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released 24 November 2020)

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

-  Fully reify -> (x != y) in the linear library.
-  Allow printing of comprehensions using introduced variables.
-  Allow increasing/decreasing over multidimensional arrays.
-  Add mzn_ignore_symmetry_breaking_constraints and mzn_ignore_redundant_constraints
   options, allowing the symmetry_breaking_constraint and redundant_constraint
   predicates to be overridden, so that those constraints can be disabled independent
   of the solver library that's being used (:bugref:`429`).
-  Add automatic coercion of strings in JSON input data to enum constants where needed.
-  Add automatic coercion of lists in JSON input data to sets where needed.

Bug fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix int_lin_eq_imp in the linear library.
-  Use variable declaration location for invalid type-inst error messages without
   locations.
-  Rewrite par versions of fzn_count_* into var versions, allowing solvers that
   only redefine the bar version to use their built-in propagators even if the
   value to count is fixed at compile time (:bugref:`427`).
-  Add multi-level array construction for enumerated types when outputting in
   JSON format.
-  Ensure that functions can only be used as par if their return type is par
   (:bugref:`431`).
-  Fix parser default location macro, preventing loss of location filenames
   in some cases.
-  Fix parser rule for non-opt sets to give the correct starting location.
-  Fix fzn_bin_packing_capa_reif.mzn and fzn_bin_packing_load_reif.mzn
   (:bugref:`435`).
-  Update decl for binary and unary operators when creating par versions of
   functions (:bugref:`437`).
-  Only throw type errors for enum type identifier mismatch in strict enums mode.
-  Only post cumulative constraints if there is at least one task, preventing an
   assertion about the lower bound from failing.
 
Changes in the IDE:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Only reset config window item focus if it is still focused, preventing spurious
   changes in focus during code checking.
-  Fix handling of final statuses, including UNSAT (:idebugref:`123`).
-  Remove -s flag support from Gecode Gist solver configuration (:idebugref:`125`).
-  Fix crash when saving a project with no solver selected (:idebugref:`127`).
-  Correctly remove temporary parameter configuration files after use
   (:idebugref:`128`, :idebugref:`129`).
-  Fix the time limit readout in the status bar when solving.

   presolver. This fixes some issues when compiling with -O3.
-  The optimisation phase of the compiler now fully substitutes par bool

.. _v2.4.0:

`Version 2.4.0 <https://github.com/MiniZinc/MiniZincIDE/releases/tag/2.4.0>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released 13 December 2019)

.. _changes-4:

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

-  The compiler now detects counting constraints in expressions such as
   count(i in x)(i=3) <= 4 and rewrites them into global counting
   constraints. This is now the preferred way to specify counting. The
   atmost/atleast/exactly constraints on integer variables have been
   deprecated, and versions of count predicates with par variables have
   been added. FlatZinc solvers that supported atmost/atleast/exactly
   should now support the corresponding fzn_count_?_par predicates.
-  The compiler now supports the command line option
   --output-detailed-timing, which provides timing information for each
   toplevel constraint item, or for each line of code when used in
   conjunction with the --keep-paths option.
-  The library now contains annotations for deprecated library
   functions.
-  A par version of the inverse function has been added (include
   inverse_fn.mzn to use it).
-  The common case of sums of optional variables is now handled more
   efficiently. This case often arises from generator expressions with
   variable where clauses.
-  Added set_to_ranges built-ins to enable efficient iteration over
   sets. These are used to implement set_in for float variables, which
   was missing before.
-  The Gurobi and CPLEX backends now support the --random-seed command
   line option.
-  The Gurobi and CPLEX backends now use nodefile for search trees
   exceeding 500 MB (--nodefilestart can change this value and
   --nodefiledir the folder.)
-  The MIPDomains optimisations have been switched back on by default.
   The optimisations have also been strengthened for some special cases.
-  Without the MIPdomains postprocessing, linearisation of variable
   domains with holes now uses set_in instead of individual not-equal
   constraints, which may result in more compact FlatZinc.
-  Linearisation of multiplication can now consider the exact domain of
   a factor.
-  The product functions have been made non-recursive in order to
   support longer arrays.
-  Bounds inference for results of if-then-else expressions has been
   improved.
-  Support for optional float variables has been added.
-  The interfaces to CBC, CPLEX and Gurobi now report correctly that
   they support verbose output during solving (so that the "verbose
   solving" option is available from the MiniZinc IDE).
-  IDE: Parse timing and statistics output produced by compiler, and
   display as profiling information next to each line in the model.
-  IDE: Enable run/compile action on data files. This automatically
   selects the model file if there is only one, or presents a dialog for
   selecting the model if there are multiple.
-  IDE: Select first data file in parameter dialog if there was no
   previous selection, and always focus parameter dialog.
-  IDE: Highlight current line.
-  IDE: Support .json as file extension for data files.
-  IDE: Remember whether wrap around, case sensitivity and regular
   expression was selected in find/replace dialog, pre-select the
   find/replace text when find/replace widget is openend, and close
   find/replace widget when ESC is pressed while editor has focus.

.. _bug-fixes-5:

Bug fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fixed output handling on Windows (output is now processed on the main
   thread, so that exceptions thrown during output are printed
   correctly, and memory management is thread safe).
-  Fixed decomposition of reified mdd constraint, and strengthened
   decompositions of mdd and cost_mdd.
-  Fix handling of variable re-definitions (e.g. converting sets to
   arrays of bools), which would previously sometimes result in
   variables being removed although they were required for output, or
   the reverse mapping function not being available in the output model.
-  Include regular.mzn from regular_regexp.mzn. (:bugref:`351`)
-  Inlining of function calls has been moved from the flattener into the
   type checker, and it now is more strict about which functions can be

-  Fixed the documentation for several constraints, which did not
   display as bullet point lists as intended.
-  Copy function/predicate declarations into FlatZinc without
   annotations, since most FlatZinc parsers would not expect annotations
   and fail to parse.
-  Process right hand side of par VarDecls to make sure any identifiers
   it uses are copied into the output model. Fixes :bugref:`336`.
-  Fix type checking for conditionals where the else branch has enum
   type but the then branch has int type.
-  Make the deopt function return correct enum instead of int type.
-  Fix for path handling when 'needRangeDomains' is active. Avoids
   infinite recursion in the compiler.

   avoid linker issues. Fixes :bugref:`325`.
-  Reset array index sets defined in lets inside recursive function
   calls.

.. _v2.3.0:

`Version 2.3.0 <https://github.com/MiniZinc/MiniZincIDE/releases/tag/2.3.0>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released 26 June 2019)

Major changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The compiler can now generate FlatZinc with half reified constraints.
   See
   https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.3.0/en/fzn-spec.html#reified-and-half-reified-predicates
   for more details.
-  The standard library of global constraints has been reorganised,
   making it easier for solvers to override just the bits that they
   support. See
   https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.3.0/en/fzn-spec.html#solver-specific-libraries
   for more details.
-  There is experimental support for solvers that can read AMPL NL
   files. See
   https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.3.0/en/solvers.html#non-linear-solvers
   for details.

.. _minor-changes-1:

Minor changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The JSON input and output has been improved, with full support for
   enums and optional types.
-  A new compiler option -g has been added, which turns variable domain
   changes into constraints (useful for debugging models).
-  The SCIP interface has been updated, with support for indicator
   constraints, bounds disjunctions and a native cumulative constraint.
-  Error reporting has been improved, with location information
   available for errors in par float expressions as well as include
   items.
-  The timeout command line parameter now also applies to compilation
   itself (:bugref:`281`).
-  Operations on par float values are now checked for overflows.
-  The arg_min/arg_max constraints have been improved, with new special
   versions for Boolean variables, and a better standard decomposition.
-  if-then-else-endif expressions with variable conditions are now
   compiled to a predicate call (rather than handled by the compiler),
   which enables solver libraries to implement these as native
   constraints or special decompositions.
-  Dividing a variable by a constant is now translated as a
   multiplication (to keep the constraints linear).
-  A new piecewise_linear predicate has been added to the library to
   make it easier to specify piecewise linear constraints.
-  Print number of solutions as mzn-stat after solving (:bugref:`244`).
-  Make search annotations work for arbitrary array index sets.
-  MiniZinc IDE: The IDE will now check MiniZinc code for syntax and
   type errors, and the editor performs simple code completion for
   MiniZinc keywords
-  MiniZinc IDE: The find/replace dialog is now an inline widget and
   supports incremental search.
-  MiniZinc IDE: Now supports dark mode on macOS.
-  MiniZinc IDE: Add support for extra solver flags (parsed from solver
   configuration).

.. _bug-fixes-8:

Bug fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Translate let expressions that contain constraints or variables as
   var type-inst. Fixes :bugref:`263`.
-  Fix JSON array parsing by counting elements instead of commas.
-  Fix parsing of the -p flag (:bugref:`271`).
-  Fix type checking for array declarations with single enum type inst
   identifier. E.g. array[$$T] of $U previously matched any
   multi-dimensional array, and now only matches one-dimensional arrays
   with any enum index set.
-  Fix computation of function return type when using type inst
   variables (:bugref:`272`).
-  Evaluate each variable declaration only once in a par let expression.
-  Check domain constraints on variable declarations in par let

   original model. This avoids reusing variable names if the user model
   contains names such as X_INTRODUCED_0_.
-  Fix compilation of nested clause/exist constraints, and improve
   handling of negation. Tries to use primitive negation instead of
   creating negated constraints. Should help with half-reification by
   creating more positive contexts.
-  Reorder fields in basic data structures to reduce padding on 64 bit
   platforms (improved memory footprint).
-  Perform type coercion after desugaring array slicing.
-  Translate arguments to bool2int, exists, forall in positive context
   even if those functions are redefined.

   before evaluating any par functions on them (:bugref:`259`).
-  Add missing redefinitions of basic operators and search annotations
   for optional integers.
-  Resolve filenames given on the command line relative to working
   directory, and warn if file in working directory has same name as
   included file from the library. Fixes :bugref:`276`.
-  Update nosets library with a valid redefinition of set_less over
   booleans.
-  Fix translation of showJSON (:bugref:`294`).
-  Only apply set2array coercion for supported types, otherwise report
   error (:bugref:`295`).
-  Improve special case reasoning for abs on strictly negative
   variables.
-  Add bounds for floating point min/max result in the standard library.
-  MiniZinc IDE: Ensure cursor is visible (editor scrolls to cursor
   position) when pressing tab or enter. Fixes :idebugref:`71` :idebugref:`71`.
-  MiniZinc IDE: Re-dock configuration editor when closing un-docked
   window.
-  MiniZinc IDE: Handle quotes when parsing additional solver command
   line arguments. Fixes :idebugref:`77`.
-  MiniZinc IDE: Add workaround for the missing libnss requirements.
   Fixes :idebugref:`79`.

.. _v2.2.0:

`Version 2.2.0 <https://github.com/MiniZinc/MiniZincIDE/releases/tag/2.2.0>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released 24 August 2018)

This is a major release of MiniZinc, introducing many new features and
improvements.

Major new features:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **New minizinc command line tool**
   Previous releases contained a ``minizinc`` command line tool that was
   not much more than a simple script that could execute the compiler,
   solver and output processor. The ``minizinc`` executable in version
   2.2.0 is now the main frontend to compilation and solving and
   integrates all of the functionality. It has access to all installed
   MiniZinc solvers (both internal solvers and those interfaced through
   FlatZinc files), and can automatically select the required options
   (e.g., to include the solver-specific MiniZinc globals library).
   You can get a list of available solvers using the ``--solvers``
   command line option, and select a solver using ``--solver``. The
   ``minizinc`` executable can now also be used as a replacement for
   ``mzn2fzn`` (using ``-c``) and ``solns2out`` (using ``--ozn-file``).
-  **Multi-pass compilation**
   The compiler can now perform multiple passes in order to improve the
   target FlatZinc code. This can be controlled using the ``-O`` command
   line flags (``-O0`` to ``-O4``). Multi-pass compilation is
   particularly useful when the target solver requires sophisticated
   decomposition of global constraints (such as for MIP solvers).
-  **Solution checking**
   You can now supply an additional model that will be used to check
   each solution produced by your main model. This can be useful for
   teaching MiniZinc (to give students automatic feedback) and if your
   main model is very complex but checking that a solution is correct is
   easy.
-  **MIP solvers:** support for FICO Xpress, and loading IBM ILOG CPLEX
   as a plugin
   We have added support for FICO Xpress (this requires compiling
   MiniZinc from sources). CPLEX can now be loaded as a plugin, which
   means that the binary distribution of MiniZinc has built-in CPLEX
   support (just bring your own CPLEX dll).
-  **Language extensions**
   The MiniZinc language has been extended with two new features.

   -  Array slicing introduces syntax to conveniently select rows,
      columns or entire slices of arrays. For example, ``x[3,..]``
      selects the third row of array ``x``, while ``x[..,4]`` selects
      the fourth column, and ``x[3..5,2..7]`` selects a slice of rows 3
      to 5 and columns 2 to 7.
   -  Generator expressions can now contain multiple where clauses, e.g.
      ``forall (i in S where foo(i), j in T where i < j) (bar(i,j))``
      This enables more efficient compilation compared to evaluating all
      where clauses in the inner-most generator. In addition to
      iteration (``i in S``), generators can now contain assignment
      expressions (``j=foo(i)``). This enables intermediate definitions
      that can then be used in further generators.

Changes and minor features:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The value of the objective can now be added automatically to the
   output using the ``--output-objective`` command line option. Using
   ``--output-mode dzn``, this allows automatic output of all the free
   variables of the model.
-  Models that do not contain a solve item are now accepted and treated
   as ``solve satisfy``
-  Support for naming constraints and expressions (using ``::"name"``
   syntax)
-  Error messages have been improved, they now contain more accurate
   location information.
-  The compiler can be instructed to accept multiple assignments to the
   same parameter (as long as they are all identical), using the
   ``--allow-multiple-assignments`` command line option.
-  Annotations for supplying warm start values have been added to the
   standard library (currently supported by the MIP solvers Gurobi and
   IBM ILOG CPLEX).
-  The compiler now accepts multiple .mzn files as input.
-  Memory consumption and garbage collection performance has been
   improved.
-  The conditional expression has been extended to support
   ``if <cond> then <exp> endif`` (where ``<exp>`` is bool)
-  Decomposition of one variable type to another (e.g. set into array of
   bool) has been improved.
-  MIP solvers Gurobi and IBM ILOG CPLEX use node files when over 3GB
   working memory
-  Gurobi and CPLEX support the MIPfocus parameter
-  Gurobi supports MiniZinc search annotations by setting fixed
   branching priorities

(released 17 November 2016)

.. _changes-13:

`Version 2.0.14 <https://github.com/MiniZinc/MiniZincIDE/releases/tag/2.0.14>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released 26 March 2016)

.. _bug-fixes-22:

Bug fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix a bug in the Common Subexpression Elimination table of the
   compiler, which could lead to some constraints being dropped
   (especially when using linear redefinitions).
-  The output model sometimes did not include all required definitions,
   in particular when array declarations used identifiers to specify the
   dimensions.
-  The generated FlatZinc sometimes still contained bool variables that
   were not connected to the rest of the model, which could produce
   incorrect solutions being printed.
-  Fix a bug where warnings (e.g. about partial functions) could lead to
   crashes.
-  Fix the bounds computation for integer and float variables, which
   could produce incorrect bounds for linear expressions. Fixes :bugref:`94`.

.. _v2.0.12:

`Version 2.0.12 <https://github.com/MiniZinc/MiniZincIDE/releases/tag/2.0.12>`__

(released 25 February 2016)

.. _changes-15:

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

-  Partial functions are now always evaluated in their Boolean context,
   independent of whether they are par or var. If the result of a
   partial function is statically known to be undefined (such as
   division by zero or array access out of bounds), and it is used in a
   constraint expression, this now results in a warning instead of an
   error. Warnings can be turned off using the ::maybe_partial
   annotation. Fixes :bugref:`43` and :bugref:`74`.

.. _bug-fixes-23:

Bug fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix a bug in the optimisation phase related to unification of aliased
   variables.

   simplification of some Boolean expressions.

   crashing. Fixes :bugref:`80`.

   an embedded conditional to crash.
-  Fix a problem with short-circuit compilation of == expressions when
   one side was a var opt bool.
-  Stop compilation when model is failed. Fixes a bug where mzn2fzn
   would sometimes not clean up the FlatZinc enough for the solver.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released 6 December 2015)

Bug fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Need to take return type into account when copying functions to
   output model. Fixes :bugref:`55`.

   available when a solver provides an alternative for the inverse
   predicate.
-  Optimisation phase now recursively checks constraints when elements
   in an array become fixed.
-  Fix CMakeLists file to work for paths that contain spaces.
-  Distinguish between infix operators and regular functions in the
   generated html documentation. Fixes :bugref:`61`.

   throw correct overflow exceptions.

   expressions.
-  Fix a crash when printing some error messages.
-  Fix compute_div_bounds builtin to return correct result for a
   division by zero.
-  Fix optimisation of Boolean constraints to use pointer equality
   instead of structural equality (same expression can occur multiple
   times in the FlatZinc).
-  Only optimise constraints that have not been removed yet.
-  Fix declaration of functional version of bin_packing_load. Fixes :bugref:`64`.
-  Set type of arrays returned from polymorphic functions. Fixes :bugref:`65`.
-  Fix parsing of quoted unary operator calls.
-  Only compute set functions when bounds are valid. Fixes :bugref:`66`.
-  Compute proper bounds for if-then-else expressions.

   Fixes :bugref:`67`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(released 5 October 2015)

.. _changes-17:

Changes:

   of conjunctions, disjunctions and clauses.
-  Add special case handling for integer division by 1.

.. _bug-fixes-28:

Bug fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix FlatZinc generator phase, need to turn all array literal
   arguments into 1-based single dimensional arrays.
-  Fix compilation of if-then-else expressions with var conditions
   (which didn't implement proper partiality/totality semantics). Fixes
   :bugref:`42`.
-  Provide correct bounds for weak opt var arithmetic. Fixes :bugref:`51`.
-  Need to be able to handle unflattened annotations. Fixes :bugref:`53`.

-  Check that var set declarations have a finite element type. Fixes :bugref:`46`.
-  Fix translation context for binary operators on arrays.
-  Need to access IntVal::infinity as a function, otherwise depending on
   linker etc it may become 0 in some cases. Fixes :bugref:`40`.
-  Change pretty printer to use one less digit when printing float
   literals. This fixes :bugref:`41` (or at least
   provides a workaround), but some double constants may still be
   rounded incorrectly when pretty printing and reading them back in.
   The real fix will be to output hex float literals (coming soon).
-  Distinguish between generalised comprehensions (iterating over sets)
   and iterating over arrays. Fixes compilation of comprehensions where
   iteration over an array is combined with var where clauses. Fixes :bugref:`45`.
-  Fix bug in creation of output model where sometimes chains of
   variable definitions could lead to crashes.
-  Avoi creating mutually recursive definitions in some corner cases,
   which could cause the compiler to run into infinite loops.
-  Don't copy vardecl items to output model that are already there.
   Fixes :bugref:`44`.
-  Remove domain from array declarations in FlatZinc (avoids problems
   with domains where holes need to be removed and when there are
   infinities in the domains)
-  Fix flattening of equality operator between non-opt and opt vars.
-  Check that model contains a single solve and output item during type
   checking (previously, multiple output items were not detected and
   resulted in incorrect .ozn files).
-  Fix flattening of xor (arguments need to be in mixed context).
-  Use is_fixed in cumulative definition.
-  Fix bug where a par right hand side of a variable mentioned in the
   output would cause a crash.
-  Fix variable dependency tracking during rewriting in the optimisation
   phase. Could previously lead to variables being removed that are
   still required. Fixes :bugref:`54`.

(released 9 December 2014)

MiniZinc 2.0 contains many new features and is based on a complete
rewrite of the MiniZinc-to-FlatZinc compiler. If you are currently using
the previous version 1.6, the new tools can be used as drop-in
replacements. The generated FlatZinc is compatible with version 1.6, so
all FlatZinc solvers should work without changes.

MiniZinc language changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  MiniZinc now supports user-defined functions. Details have been
   published in the paper "MiniZinc with Functions". Both functions and
   predicates can be recursive.
-  MiniZinc now supports option types. Details have been published in
   the paper "Modelling with Option Types in MiniZinc".
-  Let expressions have been generalised. They can now contain
   constraint items in addition to variable declarations.
-  Array index sets can be declared using arbitrary set expressions as
   long as they evaluate to contiguous ranges.
-  The if-then-else expression has been generalised to allow the
   condition to be a var bool expression (instead of only par bool).
-  Array and set comprehensions as well as generator calls can now
   iterate over variables and use var bool where conditions.
-  Any bool expression can now automatically coerce to an int
   expression, likewise for int and float. This means that you don't
   have to write bool2int or int2float in you models any more.
-  Equality constraints can now be posted between array expressions.
-  Arbitrary expressions can now be included ("interpolated") into
   strings, using the syntax "some text \\(e) some more text", where e
   is any expression. It is the same as writing "some text "++show(e)++"
   some more text".

New built-in functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Array functions: array1d, arrayXd, row, col, has_index, has_element,
   sort_by, sort, arg_sort, arg_min, arg_max

New global constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  arg_max, arg_min
-  arg_sort
-  k-dimensional diffn
-  disjunctive
-  geost
-  knapsack
-  network_flow
-  regular with NFAs
-  symmetric all different
-  optional scheduling constraints: alternative, span, disjunctive,
   cumulative
-  functional versions of many global constraints

New tool chain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  There are a few new builtins that solvers can reimplement, these are
   listed in the redefinitions-2.0 file.
-  Include items use a different method for finding included files.
   Paths are now interpreted as relative to the file that has the
   include item. That way, the mzn2fzn compiler can be called from a
   different working directory.
-  A new tool, mzn2doc, can produce html output from the documentation
   comments. The MiniZinc distribution contains the documentation for
   global constraints and builtins generated directly from the library
   source code.
