% Regression test for bug #220.  The assignment of the let-variable 'capacity'
% below should result in an error message being produced during flattening
% because there are different array indexes on the LHS and RHS.
% mzn2fzn 1.3.1 and before do not detect this and instead produced an array
% with an incorrect index set.
