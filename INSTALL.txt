MiniZinc 2
=========================

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

These instructions are for compiling and installing MiniZinc 2 from the
source distribution.

MiniZinc 2 is based on the libminizinc C++ library. In order
to compile and install libminizinc you will need the following
software:

Compilation instructions:
-------------------------

Prerequisite software:
- cmake
- A recent C++ compiler, libminizinc has been tested with recent versions of
  clang, g++, and Microsoft Visual C++.
- If you intend to change lexer/parser templates or checkout development
  snapshots, the bison and flex parser/lexer generators. These usually come
  packaged for Linux distributions, and they are part of the Xcode developer
  tools for Mac OS. On Windows, simplest is to have MinGW(64) tools on the
  path, or use winFlexBison.

Download the source code from the git repository or uncompress a source
archive. Then change into the toplevel directory (the one containing this file).

To perform the build:
> mkdir build
> cd build/
> cmake ..
> cmake --build .

This will compile the mzn-fzn driver by default. To enable other solvers, 
set their paths e.g. as 'cmake -DGECODE_HOME="___" ..', see the example BUILD.*
scripts and CMakeLists.txt for available interfaces. In Windows, when using
64-bit versions of solver libraries, add -G"Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64".

To install MiniZinc:
> cmake --build . --target install

This will install MiniZinc in the standard location for you system. In order
to change the installation prefix, invoke cmake as follows before invoking
cmake --build:

> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<where you want to install> ..

Running
-------

The build produces the mzn2fzn and
solns2out tools. These are drop-in replacements for the MiniZinc 1.6 versions.

Add the bin directory in the installation path to your PATH environment variable if necessary,
or (if you did not install) add the "build" directory to your PATH.

Except for specialized solvers, we currently do not provide the minizinc driver program that was part
of MiniZinc 1.6 in the source distribution. It is however included in the
binary distributions. If you have both MiniZinc 1.6 and 2 installed (and MiniZinc 2.0
occurs on the PATH before 1.6), you can use the old minizinc driver
with the new versions of mzn2fzn and solns2out.
