   call expressions. Fixes #177.
 - Fix incorrect simplification of Boolean constraints assigned to variables
   that are assigned to false
 - Fix bug in flattening of linear equations that contain the same variable on
   both sides

Version 2.1.5
=============

Changes:
 - Some improvements to the linearisation library.
 - Make parser read multiple .mzn files correctly.
 - Enable better bounds computation for array access expressions on
   fixed arrays.
 - Perform better constant folding during optimisation phase. Fixes #155.
 - Don't rewrite pow function into multiplication in the case of power of 2.
 - Save some memory by making certain internal data structures more compact.
 - Improve source code location of identifiers in generator calls (should give
   more precise error messages).
 - Produce an error message when a comprehension attempts to iterate over an
   infinite set.
 - Produce better error messages for operations on infinite values (previously
   some errors did not contain a source code location).

 - Remove incorrect closing bracket from json output. Fixes #154.
 - Fix bounds computation of par int and float arrays.
 - Don't allow var access to arrays of strings or annotations (since that would
   require an element constraint and var string / var ann types).

 - Detect failure earlier if optimisation pass leads to fixing of variables
   outside their domains.

Bug fixes:
 - Fix CBC backend to correctly print UNSAT message for models where the
   compiler already detected unsatisfiability, and print solution separators
   even where there is no other output.
 - Add missing var_dom function for arrays of optional integer variables.

   Fixes #129.

Version 2.1.2
=============

Bug fixes:
 - Fix a bug in the type checking for generators that iterate over
   arrays of enums.
 - Fix a bug in the output handling of arrays of enums.
 - Fix handling of multiple output items (only the last item was
   compiled, now the concatenation is used for output as defined
   in the specification).

Version 2.1.1
=============

Changes:
 - Add missing min/max functions for set variables. Can be redefined to solver
   builtins using the new redefinitions-2.1.1.mzn library file.
 - Add support for option type expressions as objective functions.
 - Automatically coerce arrays constructed using ++ to any enum index set
   (in addition to array literals and comprehensions).

Bug fixes:
 - Include cmath header to fix compilation issues with some compilers. Fixes #125.
 - Fix a garbage collection bug in the type checking for enumerated types that would
   sometimes lead to crashes or incorrect error messages.
 - Fix type checking of comprehensions that involve enumerated types.
 - Fix bounds computation for var sets of enumerated types.
 - Support anon_enum function as documented.

Version 2.1.0
=============

Changes:
 - MiniZinc now supports enumerated types.
 - Solvers can be interfaced directly to the MiniZinc library, and MiniZinc
   comes with direct support for the CBC, Gurobi and CPLEX MIP solvers.
 - The linearisation library has been updated, resulting in much better FlatZinc
   being generated for MIP solvers.
 - Data files can be in JSON format, and MiniZinc can produce JSON output
   (using the --output-mode command line option).
 - Variables can be annotated as ::add_to_output instead of writing an output
   item.
 - The compiler can output information about the parameters and output variables
   of a model (using the --model-interface-only option).
 - Floats are handled better (detecting infinities and handling sets of floats).
 - Bounds can be computed for more expressions (instead of failing with an error
   message).

Bug fixes:
 - Fix a bug in optimization that could remove variables even if they are used.
   Fixes #123.
 - Fix float variable declarations with sets of floats as domains.
   Fixes #117 and #98.
 - Fix type checking and evaluation of asserts with array arguments. Fixes #109.
 - Fix abs(var float) declaration to work on floats without declared bounds.
   Fixes #106.
 - Fix a bug in the computation of int and float bounds that could result in
   incorrect bounds in some cases. Fixes #94.
 - Fix garbage collection when creating output models. Fixes #77.
 - Fix binary operators on optional variables (in some cases comparison
   operators were reversed).
 - Fix optimization of unconstrained variables (could sometimes lead to
   constraints being removed although they were not subsumed).
 

Version 2.0.14
==============

Changes:

 - Less aggressive aggregation of linear expressions in cases where it
   leads to much less efficient FlatZinc.
 - Don't create temporary variable for an array literal if it is discarded
   immediately anyway.
 - Only create new partiality variable for if-then-else expression if there's
   at least one var condition.
 - Replace recursive definitions of array_intersect and array_union with
   iterative ones.

Bug fixes:
 - Don't report warnings about partiality when using extended generator
   expressions.
 - Include cmath to enable building with some versions of gcc.
 - Constrain result of function call based on function return type if necessary.
 - Make sure linear expressions generated during binding of variables are
   properly flattened (including simplification of the linear expression)


Version 2.0.13
==============

Bug fixes:

 - Fix a bug in the Common Subexpression Elimination table of the compiler,
   which could lead to some constraints being dropped (especially when using
   linear redefinitions).
 - The output model sometimes did not include all required definitions,
   in particular when array declarations used identifiers to specify the
   dimensions.
 - The generated FlatZinc sometimes still contained bool variables that were
   not connected to the rest of the model, which could produce incorrect
   solutions being printed.
 - Fix a bug where warnings (e.g. about partial functions) could lead to
   crashes.
 - Fix the bounds computation for integer and float variables, which could
   produce incorrect bounds for linear expressions. Fixes #94.

Version 2.0.12
==============

Changes:

 - Partial functions are now always evaluated in their Boolean context,
   independent of whether they are par or var. If the result of a partial
   function is statically known to be undefined (such as division by zero or
   array access out of bounds), and it is used in a constraint expression,
   this now results in a warning instead of an
   error. Warnings can be turned off using the ::maybe_partial annotation.
   Fixes #43 and #74.

Bug fixes:

 - Fix a bug in the optimisation phase related to unification of aliased
   variables.
 - Fix short-circuit evaluation of Boolean expressions.
 - Fix a bug in the optimisation phase related to repeated simplification of
   some Boolean expressions.
 - Handle errors in output produced by solver without solns2out crashing.
   Fixes #80.
 - Fix a bug in the integer bounds computation that caused bool2int with an
   embedded conditional to crash.
 - Fix a problem with short-circuit compilation of == expressions when one
   side was a var opt bool.
 - Stop compilation when model is failed. Fixes a bug where mzn2fzn would
   sometimes not clean up the FlatZinc enough for the solver.

Version 2.0.11
==============

Bug fixes:

 - Fix parsing of hex and octal literals. Fixes #71.
 - Fix compilation of extended comprehensions. Fixes #72.
 - Fix computation of float array access bounds.
 - Fix aggregation of clauses (could sometimes ignore the negative literals).

Version 2.0.10
==============

Bug fixes:

 - Fix a bug in the optimiser that could lead to undefined variables in the
   generated FlatZinc. Fixes #70.

Version 2.0.9
=============

Bug fixes:

 - Need to take return type into account when copying functions to output
   model. Fixes #55.
 - Evaluate calls that result in arrays using eval_arraylit. Fixes #57.
 - Move inverse function to its own library file, so that it remains available
   when a solver provides an alternative for the inverse predicate.
 - Optimisation phase now recursively checks constraints when elements in an
   array become fixed.
 - Fix CMakeLists file to work for paths that contain spaces.
 - Distinguish between infix operators and regular functions in the generated
   html documentation. Fixes #61.
 - Made parser more robust against incorrect code.
 - Fix increment/decrement operators for IntVals and make all operations throw
   correct overflow exceptions.
 - Fix automatic type coercion for variables declared in let expressions.
 - Fix a crash when printing some error messages.
 - Fix compute_div_bounds builtin to return correct result for a division by
   zero.
 - Fix optimisation of Boolean constraints to use pointer equality instead of
   structural equality (same expression can occur multiple times in the
   FlatZinc).
 - Only optimise constraints that have not been removed yet.
 - Fix declaration of functional version of bin_packing_load. Fixes #64.
 - Set type of arrays returned from polymorphic functions. Fixes #65.
 - Fix parsing of quoted unary operator calls.
 - Only compute set functions when bounds are valid. Fixes #66.
 - Compute proper bounds for if-then-else expressions.
 - Report error when no reified version of a constraint is available. Fixes #67.
 - Fix type checking of annotations on binary operators.
 - Keep annotations when rewriting linear constraints and remove is_defined_var
   annotations from fixed variables. Fixes #69.

Changes:

 - Integer, Boolean and float literals are now cached to achieve better memory
   performance for some models.
 - Improve performance of parsing integer literals.
 - Improve handling of clause constraints.
 - Add source files of MiniZinc specification to the repository.
 - Limit maximum array size to enable better error messages.
 - Add implied_constraint predicate as a synonym for redundant_constraint.

Version 2.0.8
=============

Bug fixes:

 - Fix incorrect negation of some reified comparisons.
 - Make lb/ub functions work in more cases.
 - Fix several bugs in the optimisation phase (could lead to incorrect
   FlatZinc and crashes).
 - Fix a problem with reverse mapper functions when the result of the reverse
   mapper can be fixed to a constant.

Version 2.0.7
=============

Changes:
 - Improved propagation of Boolean constants in the optimisation phase. This
   should result in far fewer aliases and improves simplification of
   conjunctions, disjunctions and clauses.
 - Add special case handling for integer division by 1.

Bug fixes:

 - Fix FlatZinc generator phase, need to turn all array literal arguments into
   1-based single dimensional arrays.
 - Fix compilation of if-then-else expressions with var conditions (which didn't
   implement proper partiality/totality semantics). Fixes #42.
 - Provide correct bounds for weak opt var arithmetic. Fixes #51.
 - Need to be able to handle unflattened annotations. Fixes #53.
 - Fix generation of output model (needs to ignore items that have been removed
   previously).
 - Add missing lb(var set of int) builtin. Fixes #47.
 - Check that var set declarations have a finite element type. Fixes #46.
 - Fix translation context for binary operators on arrays.
 - Need to access IntVal::infinity as a function, otherwise depending on linker
   etc it may become 0 in some cases. Fixes #40.
 - Change pretty printer to use one less digit when printing float literals.
   This fixes #41 (or at least provides a workaround), but some double
   constants may still be rounded incorrectly when pretty printing and reading
   them back in. The real fix will be to output hex float literals (coming
   soon).
 - Distinguish between generalised comprehensions (iterating over sets) and
   iterating over arrays. Fixes compilation of comprehensions where iteration
   over an array is combined with var where clauses. Fixes #45.
 - Fix bug in creation of output model where sometimes chains of variable
   definitions could lead to crashes.
 - Avoi creating mutually recursive definitions in some corner cases, which
   could cause the compiler to run into infinite loops.
 - Don't copy vardecl items to output model that are already there. Fixes #44.
 - Remove domain from array declarations in FlatZinc (avoids problems with
   domains where holes need to be removed and when there are infinities in the
   domains)
 - Fix flattening of equality operator between non-opt and opt vars
 - Check that model contains a single solve and output item during type
   checking (previously, multiple output items were not detected and resulted
   in incorrect .ozn files).
 - Fix flattening of xor (arguments need to be in mixed context).
 - Use is_fixed in cumulative definition.
 - Fix bug where a par right hand side of a variable mentioned in the output
   would cause a crash.
 - Fix variable dependency tracking during rewriting in the optimisation phase.
   Could previously lead to variables being removed that are still required.
   Fixes #54.

Version 2.0.6
=============

Changes:
 - Add parser support for hexadecimal floating point constants.

Bug fixes:
 - Fix bounds computation for some calls (abs, int_times).
 - Fix flattening of some array declarations (when right hand side is
   an identifier).
 - Add four missing GC locks (could lead to incorrect garbage collection).
 - Compact output model only after optimisation phase (could lead to 
   incorrect items being removed from output model).

Version 2.0.5
=============

Changes:
 - Improve the standard decomposition for the cumulative constraint.
 - Better handling of binary operators during type checking and flattening,
   can sometimes avoid stack overflows (e.g. for large conjunctions).
 - Make ++ operator left associative (avoid stack overflows in the parser).
 - Add ::domain annotations to linear constraints generated from
   multi-dimensional element constraints.
 - Greatly improved linearisation library.

Bug fixes:
 - Fix recursive function calls that contain let expressions.

   expressions.

Version 2.0.4
=============

Changes:

   "--input-from-stdin" command line options). Thanks to Sebastian Kosch.
 - Improved handling of bool2int during FlatZinc generation.

Bug fixes:
 - Fix unification of aliased variables which could sometimes result in
   variables being removed although had a constraining right hand side.

Version 2.0.3
=============

  (Internal release that did not contain some essential fixes)

Version 2.0.2
=============

Changes:
 - The optimiser now removes simple domain constraints from the FlatZinc
 - The compiler now checks for integer overflows in all built-in operations
 - Report an error when the FlatZinc or ozn file cannot be opened for writing

 - Add row/col functions for variable arrays (github issue #2)
 - Introduce builtins for creating random distributions
 - Add reverse library function
 - Postpone flattening of some reified constraints
 - Slightly improved compilation of partial function calls when it can be 
   inferred at compile time that their result is undefined
 - Allow functions with empty argument lists to be declared as
   function int: foo(); instead of just function int: foo;
 - Improve error reporting, in particular for errors in comprehensions
 - Enable expressions a..b where a and b are integer variables
 - Add redundant_constraint and symmetry_breaking_constraint builtins, these
   can be rewritten by solver libraries to allow e.g. local search solvers to
   ignore redundant constraints.
 - Improve flattening of predicates that simply return their arguments (makes
   the redundant_constraint and symmetry_breaking_constraint predicates work
   in more situations).
 - Replace command line option --only-range-domains by optional boolean value
   so that solver libraries can set the flag directly in their redefinitions
   file.
 - Stop flattening immediately when a model has been found to contain an
   inconsistency.
 - Improve flattening of array access expressions, in particular for nested
   array accesses that can be combined into a single element constraint
 - Add command line option -s or --statistics to print statistics about the
   generated FlatZinc
 - Improve bounds computation for if-then-else expressions
 - Clause arguments are compiled in positive and negative contexts instead of
   mixed. That means that predicates that introduce free variables can now

   generator
 - Report type error on some ambiguous function calls

Version 2.0.0
=============

MiniZinc 2.0 contains many new features and is based on a complete rewrite of
the MiniZinc-to-FlatZinc compiler. If you are currently using the previous
version 1.6, the new tools can be used as drop-in replacements. The generated
FlatZinc is compatible with version 1.6, so all FlatZinc solvers should work
without changes.

** MiniZinc language changes **

 - MiniZinc now supports user-defined functions. Details have been published
   in the paper "MiniZinc with Functions". Both functions and predicates can
   be recursive.
 - MiniZinc now supports option types. Details have been published in the
   paper "Modelling with Option Types in MiniZinc".
 - Let expressions have been generalised. They can now contain constraint
   items in addition to variable declarations.
 - Array index sets can be declared using arbitrary set expressions as long as
   they evaluate to contiguous ranges.
 - The if-then-else expression has been generalised to allow the condition to
   be a var bool expression (instead of only par bool).
 - Array and set comprehensions as well as generator calls can now iterate
   over variables and use var bool where conditions.
 - Any bool expression can now automatically coerce to an int expression,
   likewise for int and float. This means that you don't have to write
   bool2int or int2float in your models any more.
 - Equality constraints can now be posted between array expressions.
 - Arbitrary expressions can now be included ("interpolated") into strings,
   using the syntax "some text \(e) some more text", where e is any
   expression. It is the same as writing "some text "++show(e)++" some more
   text".

** New built-in functions **

Array functions: array1d, arrayXd, row, col, has_index, has_element, sort_by,
sort, arg_sort, arg_min, arg_max

** New global constraints **

 - arg_max, arg_min
 - arg_sort
 - k-dimensional diffn
 - disjunctive
 - geost
 - knapsack
 - network_flow
 - regular with NFAs
 - symmetric all different
 - optional scheduling constraints: alternative, span, disjunctive, cumulative
 - functional versions of many global constraints

** New tool chain **

 - There are a few new builtins that solvers can reimplement, these are listed
   in the redefinitions-2.0 file.
 - Include items use a different method for finding included files. Paths are
   now interpreted as relative to the file that has the include item. That
   way, the mzn2fzn compiler can be called from a different working directory.
 - A new tool, mzn2doc, can produce html output from the documentation
   comments. The MiniZinc distribution contains the documentation for global
   constraints and builtins generated directly from the library source code.
