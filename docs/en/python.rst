Python Interface
================

MiniZinc can be directly used from Python using the MiniZinc Python package. This package provides
an native python interface that interacts directly with the MiniZinc bundle installed on the
machine. For installation instructions and more information about the package that provides the
MiniZinc python interface please visit https://minizinc-python.readthedocs.io/.


..  warning::
    The development of MiniZinc Python is still in the very early stages. We appreciate any feedback
    for the package, but we would recommend refraining from using the package in production
    software. The package can drastically change and backwards compatible changes are not
    guaranteed.
