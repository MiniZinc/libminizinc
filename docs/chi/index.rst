The MiniZinc Handbook
=====================

MiniZinc is a free and open-source constraint modeling language. You can use MiniZinc to model constraint satisfaction and optimization problems in a high-level, solver-independent way, taking advantage of a large library of pre-defined constraints.

This handbook consists of four parts: :numref:`part-introduction` covers installation and basic steps; :numref:`part-tutorial` is a tutorial-style introduction into modelling with MiniZinc; :numref:`part-manual` is a user manual for the individual tools in the MiniZinc tool chain; and :numref:`part-reference` is a reference to the language.
