% FlatZinc builtins
%
%  This section contains declarations for the standard FlatZinc builtins.  They
%  can be redefined by providing a custom redefinitions.mzn in the solver
%  globals library. A standard redefinition is provided for FlatZinc builtins
%  after version 2.0. This redefinition can be overriden by providing a custom
%  redefinitions-<VERSION>.mzn
